v0.2.0:
- Reworked dragging detection, now uses GuiImageButton instead of checking left mouse down,
  which means it uses the native mouse event blocking functionality instead of manually disabling wand shooting etc
- Removed mouse_down event for widgets (because now it's not detectable anymore when dragging is enabled)

v0.1.0:
- Added mouse_down(self, x, y) event to widget (only works)
